## Final Project Android App
<p>For my final project I had quite a few issues.  I decide to simplfy it.
My app calculates the demensions of a Transmission line eclosure for a speaker. I did want
it to use sqlite, but I couldn't get it to run on the emulator.  I even thought
about writing a block chain for it, but ran out of time.</p>
